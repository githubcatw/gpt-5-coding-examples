  Create a single-page app in a single HTML file for interactive language flashcards.
  - Ask a visitor which language they want to learn (English, Spanish, French, or Japanese)
  - Consider visitor's locale to translate the UI by default
  - Display cards with flip animations to reveal the translation on the back.
  - Create 10 built-in questions for each language; these ten should be useful phrases when traveling.
  - Include a “shuffle” and “mark as learned” function with smooth animations.
