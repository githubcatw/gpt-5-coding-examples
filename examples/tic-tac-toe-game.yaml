    • Mode: 2-player or vs AI
    • First move: X or O
    • AI discipline: Perfect / Pragmatic / Reckless
  - Game logic:
    • Perfect-play AI via minimax with difficulty handicaps
    • Scoreboard for X, O, and Draws
    • Gold win highlight + non-overlapping victory banner under header
    • Canvas-based confetti on win (no DOM node spraying), respects prefers-reduced-motion
  - Accessibility: ARIA roles for grid/cells, live status updates, keyboard + touch support.
  - Visuals: smooth hover/press states, soft shadows, rounded corners, scalable typography.
  - Constraints: no element overlap or flashing; no external JS frameworks; one HTML file with inline CSS/JS (Google Fonts allowed).
