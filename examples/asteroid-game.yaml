title: Asteroid Game
prompt: |
  Make a 2d space game, in which I can fly a ship, avoid and blow up asteroids, and dogfight with other computer-controlled AI. Be creative with the design of the ships. Ensure the gameplay works and is fun.
  Output code in a single next.js page.tsx file, which can be pasted directly into a next.js app created by create-next-app, alongside any context or instructions needed to run it.
